# TODOAPP-Exercise
task app using javascript , html and css 
In this app I had the chance to deeply learn these languages. 
Before I just used them as comlement while building a webpage (e-commerce) with pythong and Dyango. 
I saw a tuturial on javascript and a todo app was the most recomend exercise to do. I found that 
there are many similiraties with python . Specially regarding fuctions and iterations. 
Regarding css , I also had the oporutnity to learn how to work with flexboxs, grids and positions.
